I am sure that is a contributing factor.\nWhat am I doing wrong?",

Aside from not relocating to sunny Georgia and sipping Mint Juleps in the shade...\nYou need to be soaking your bike in a good rust inhibitor/corrosion inhibitor. In fact, you should be using so much of it...knowing your winter riding habits through the War Zone at night...that you would be investing in their public stock offers.\nBuy any of these products by the 55-gallon drum:  CorrosionPro Lube, CRC Heavy Duty, LPS-3 and/or Boeshield T-9.\nUse them in liberal amounts. Apply before riding. Apply after riding. Hell, apply them AS you pedal. It is Detroit, after all.",
